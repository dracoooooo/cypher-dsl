=== 2023.0.0

Welcome to 2023, welcome Java 17, welcome Neo4j 5 clauses. This is the first release of the Cypher-DSL requiring Java 17. This is in line with Neo4j itself, Spring Data Neo4j 7 and several other frameworks out there. This allows for more concise code (which is nice for us) as well as using the Neo4j 5 parser in `neo4j-cypher-dsl-parser` module. Bumping the JDK warrants a major upgrade already.

Apart from that we have been very reluctant on breaking changes. As a matter of fact, close to none has been necessary. One of the few improvements that might need changes on your side is #551 (Commit 10080df) in which we improved the `WITH` clause: You might see ambiguous method errors and the fix can be seen https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/cypher-dsl/commit/10080df4c537742218584d80bf4682dd74088a15#diff-dd86a606c4e4fe3151d8d7bb6af70b1aeecb25b5a32bcc9e9862483ca666a261[here] for example: Either use JDK 17 reserved name `var` for local variable type-inference or use explicit `IdentifiableElement`.

There's a lot of new stuff as well: You can now use `Expressions.count` to build new Neo4j 5 `COUNT` expressions and we do support the `USE` clause for composite database queries as well.

Please fear not if you are still on JDK 8: We will maintain the 2022.8.x branch at least as long as Spring Data Neo4j 6.3 is maintained, as the latter is build on top of the Cypher-DSL and is JDK 8, too.

Thanks a lot to our friend @ikwattro from @graphaware for his continuous and well appreciated feedback and input to this project.

==== üêõ Bug Fixes
